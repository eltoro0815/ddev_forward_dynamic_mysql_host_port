# ddev_forward_dynamic_mysql_host_port
This is a PowerShell script _ddev_forward_dynamic_mysql_host_port_port.ps1_.
This gets the dynamic port from the _ddev describe_ json output and 
updates port forwarding using the _netsh interface portproxy_ command.

Why do we want this? We can now connect to port 3306 on our host and reach the MySQL database in the container.
The port generated by ddev and accessible by the host, on the other hand, is regenerated every time the container is restarted.

1. get **jq** from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/ (it is needed to read the json output).
2. put the _ddev_forward_dynamic_mysql_host_port.ps1_ script in your project folder.
3. run the script as administrator.
